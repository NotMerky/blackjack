## Introduction

This is a small game that I created in High School AP Computer Science

You play the classic game of Blackjack, it's one on one with you against the dealer.
The only controls are 'SPACE' to continue, 'S' to Stand, and 'H' to Hit.

The game makes usage of several icons found online through various sources.

## Installation

The upload is the raw VSCode Project that I had created the project in. If you run the BlackjackRunner.java file the game will start.
